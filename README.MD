<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Anatoly</h1>
<h3 align="center">Kotlin Backend developer and Linux Enthusiast</h3>

I've been developing backend with Kotlin from 2018, and not only Kotlin, but mostly Kotlin.

I've also worked with JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, PHP.

I enjoy creating custom tools to simplify work and solve arising issues. Some of them can be found on my GitHub

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Kotlin wrapper for Reveal JS with CLI [RevealKt](https://github.com/LimeBeck/reveal-kt) and [Build Time Config Gradle plugin](https://github.com/LimeBeck/build-time-config) for embedding static application configuration at compile 

- 📝 I sometimes write articles on [blog.limebeck.dev](https://blog.limebeck.dev)
